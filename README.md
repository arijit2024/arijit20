As a full-stack developer with expertise in both backend and frontend technologies, I‚Äôve worked extensively with a variety of tools and frameworks. On the backend, I‚Äôm well-versed in Laravel (a PHP framework), which allows me to build robust APIs and handle server-side logic efficiently. For databases, I‚Äôve used MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

On the frontend, I specialize in Next.js and React, creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. JavaScript is my go-to language for client-side development. Additionally, I‚Äôve customized WordPress and WooCommerce sites, integrating them seamlessly with various APIs and third-party services.

Beyond that, I‚Äôve dabbled in Webflow and Wix for rapid prototyping and website design. And when it comes to creating interactive prototypes or animations, Framer is a tool I enjoy exploring.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with your projects!
